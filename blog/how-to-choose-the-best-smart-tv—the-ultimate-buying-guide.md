Hello folks. This week, smart TV it is. Now let's begin with the basics for those who are newbies to the concept of a smart TV. What's a smart TV anyway? It's just our commonly known TV evolving to fit into the barrage of 'Smart devices' category. In simple terms, it's pretty much in line with smartphones and other smart gadgets, which ultimately integrate into the 'smart' lifestyle like—smart homes and cars. Smart TVs are fast replacing traditional TVs, the reason why smart TV price has recently become more within an affordable range.

**What exactly does a smart TV do differently from the last generation TVs?**

Previous generation tube TVs could display only with the help of cable, HDTV antennae or some A/V connection system. Smart TVs integrate internet connectivity, host processors like computers do, enable app support, have easy navigation software, accessing media files from computer storage, etc. So along with the primary function of media broadcasting, it opens up the scope for video streaming via OTTs and YouTube, playing video games, using social media, internet surfing, and integrating with smart home devices like smart lights and smart locks. Many are also including voice recognition like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. All in all, it is revolutionalizing the way TVs used to work.

**Who are selling smart TVs in India?**

The smart TV sector recorded a boom with 55% annual growth in the 2021 Q1. During this quarter, brands like Xiaomi, LG, Samsung and Sony have established themselves as the market leaders in India. Xiaomi is leading the smart TV segment with a 17% market share. Samsung & LG are in the second and third positions, respectively, with 16% and 14% market shares.

With most TV OEMs adding more smart TVs to their portfolios, the smart TV price has hit an affordable range offering a base starting price at $160 (around 12,000 Rupees), according to Counterpoint Research.

**What features to look for before buying a smart TV?**

So now that it's apparent that a smart TV is full of capabilities surpassing our old generation televisions, we need to be acquainted with what features and specs to look for before buying a smart TV.

**Price**: Smart TVs are available within a range of ₹20,000 to a few lakhs. 

**Brands**: Smart TVs in India are being produced by leading electronic brands like Samsung, LG, Sony, Redmi and Realme.  

Genie has shortlisted the main features to know before buying your smart TV:

**Screen Size**: The available screen size ranges from 24" to 80". Most purchases are observed within the 40" to 55" range.  

**Display**: Available in LED, OLED and QLED display. OLED offers the best among the three, but both OLED and QLED are in the higher range of pricing and are available in the top-end models. The QLED is a modification of the LED screen but OLED scores above QLED. The LED display is the most sought after choice for budget buys and is available in high resolutions as well. 

**Panel**: VA and IPS are the two panels available. VA monitors are mostly cheaper than an equivalent IPS monitor, but both have a similar user experience. The downside for VA monitors is that they suffer from more motion blur and ghosting glitches than IPS panels. So IPS panel is the better option to choose between the two.  

**Screen resolution**: The higher the screen resolution, the sharper are the images and the better the picture quality. Smart TVs are available in HD (High Definition) 720p, Full HD 1080p, Ultra HD 4K and 8K resolutions. If budget constraints are not there, the best option is to choose a 4K resolution. 

**Refresh rate**: The common refresh rate of TVs is 60Hz. 90Hz is a good enough refresh rate for action movies and gaming experiences. For Smart TVs, one need not go beyond the 120Hz refresh rate.  

**Sound**: The smart TV speakers come powered with at least 20-22 Watts and go higher. The decibel efficiency is what makes the difference in sound quality. Smart TVs use Dolby Atmos or Q Symphony for an all surround sound effect and enhance the experience. You can invest in a good soundbar available within ₹7000-₹8000 to further the sound effects. 

**Android TVs and Smart TVs**: Android TVs use Android OS, while the remaining smart TVs have their own OS. Samsung uses Tizen and LG uses Web OS in their models. It is a good idea to get an Android TV because it can integrate with your Android smartphone and directly cast content from the phone. You can access Google Playstore and apps. Most Android TVs come with a built-in Chromecast support that helps to cast content directly from your PC, smartphone or tablet. If the model supports voice recognition, you can use Google Assistant to control other smart devices in your home too. 

**Connectivity Ports**: It's best to get Smart TVs that have at least 3 HDMI ports and 2 USB ports. The reason being multiple devices are used along with the smart TV. Also, for ease of accessibility, it's good to have one HDMI and one USB port on the TV side. This, along with double band Wi-Fi should go together.

**Chromecast**: It's a feature available on Android TVs. It allows you to use the TV display as a replacement for your computer, smartphone or tablet screen.
