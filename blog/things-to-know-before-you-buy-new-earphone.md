From listening to the light mood music to attending the official meetings, headphones have become our daily friends over the last few years. 

In this short article, we will be explaining you about the different types of headphones and which one you should choose based on your usage and comfort. \
\
\
**1. IN-EAR  -** 

This category is surely the most portable and most popular among all others.  It is light and easier to carry. As technology allows for higher sound quality from smaller devices, these models have been able to quickly improve to compete with the heavier on-ear and over-ear models. 

This style can have awesome sound quality depending on the model and is preferred by a lot of users. From office-going people who need a lot of travel to the fitness freaks who are busy in the gym to maintain their bodies, it can be used by everyone. The in-ear ones are more noise-reducing and offer a better audio experience than others. \

**2. ON-EAR  -** 

O[](https://www.wirerealm.com/guides/top-10-best-on-ear-headphones)n-ear headphones go over the head and rest on top of the ears. This style of headphones is usually quite comfortable and doesn’t cause you to sweat as much as over-the-ear models. It just covers your ear properly & rests there only. On-ear models can vary greatly in terms of quality but if you get one of the higher quality models they will deliver on the categories you care the most about sound quality and comfort. 

If you want to carry on a conversation or hear the world around you while enjoying music, on-ear headphones are much safer. This is a good choice for gamers, coders and people who are always connected to their computer. The drawback with this is that it could cause discomfort for the ears if used for a longer time.

\
**3. OVER-THE-EAR  -**  \
\
The main advantage where over-the-ear headphones easily win is ANC. ANC is active noise cancellation & it's truly a differentiating factor nowadays. Generally, over-the-ear covers the whole ear area & its surroundings for true noise cancellation. 

As its weights are a little more, so one person who is in a stable mood for a long time, it suits best for them. However, this style is usually closed-back as they are preferred for their potential noise cancellation, isolation, and high-quality sound capability. Usage is same as on ear but since your entire ear is covered, there is very less discomfort for the ears. But this is usually heavier than on ear.\
