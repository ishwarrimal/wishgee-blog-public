 **1G to 5G journey**

       The first 1G smartphone network was launched by Nippon in 1979 just after 6 years of its origin in Japan. As per the latest research, Russia is the only country that still uses a 1G network for some causes.\
\
       In 1991 Finland first introduced 2G GSM networks to the world. We all still remind Nokia 3210 and such kind of ‘candy bar phones’ from our childhood, those are the torchbearer of that era.

3G network was first introduced by NTT Docomo in Japan in 2001. Those phones have 4 times data transferring capabilities than 2G , which is near 2Mbps. From Blackberry’s first phone Blackberry 5810 to Apple’s first ever smartphone iPhone 1, those all released in that era.\
\
    Currently most countries are using 4G technology which was working from 2009 and provides high-quality video streaming/chat, fast mobile web access, HD videos, and online gaming. iPhone 6 is considered one of the most successful in this era.\
\
   Latest in this list is the 5G network which was introduced in South Korea in march’19 is a truly pathbreaking & mesmerizing innovation. Already various companies like Sony, Huawei,  Blackberry, Realme, IQOO, OnePlus are in the way of making these smartphones or already made it.
