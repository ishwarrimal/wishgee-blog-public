***Weekend exploration & Sporting***\
\
As a cyclist, there’s nothing like a long ride or sports to bring a sense of accomplishment, and of course, those require a certain level of endurance, and it’s best to work on gradually building your cycle matching with all those criteria.\
\
In weekend-long trips or sports surely go for robust front brakes as they’ll help you to track the control. Choosing geared cycles with a standard gear ratio is mandatory to maintain wheel RPM. In the sports field (exp - BMX) some opt for a little more height of handlebar so that they can bend and use aerodynamics to increase speed. When you’re thinking about any adventurous expedition, the stiff and rigid build material is a choice for sure and Titanium or alloy-made body parts are always preferable. Here you will need speed to complete on time and thin tires with low rolling resistance which can handle a range of pressures will help you to do that. Generally speaking, pocket pinch must cross 15k to a few lakhs range to choose the best option here.\
